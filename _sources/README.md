## Wireless Color Sensor

This is a tool for direct use with an OT-2 liquid handler, which allows for sampling a discrete light spectrum (8 wavelengths) at various wellplate positions. The tool is wireless both in power and data transfer.

The documentation for this project including a full set of build instructions is hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://AccelerationConsortium.github.io/wireless-color-sensor/).
